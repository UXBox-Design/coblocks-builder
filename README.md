# CoBlocks Builder

A prototype custom build script for CoBlocks. Currently it:

* Clones the current master branch of CoBlocks
* Copies a custom blocks.js file to the source folder to only build selected blocks
* Runs CoBlocks standard grunt build job
* Removes src folder from coblocks/build/coblocks folder
